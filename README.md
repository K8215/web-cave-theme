An edgy WordPress theme for L33t Hax0rs.

See it in action on my website: https://kateswebcave.com

The Web Cave theme features standard post, page, and comment functionality plus a custom navigation menu and an added projects post type. Project posts have their own archive where they display in a thumbnail grid that emphasizes the featured image.
